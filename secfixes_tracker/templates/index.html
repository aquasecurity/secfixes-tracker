<h1>Security Issue Tracker</h1>

<p>This is a security issue tracker used to monitor security issues that affect the
Alpine Linux distribution.  It is derived from the <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/">
CVE dictionary</a>, the <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov">NVD database</a> and Alpine's
own <a href="https://secdb.alpinelinux.org">security fixes database</a>.</p>

<p>If you are a packager and your package erroneously appears vulnerable on this
tracker, please make sure that your APKBUILD has secfixes data in it.  Once the
corrected secfixes data is published, it should take less than 24 hours for the
tracker to update.  If there are still problems, please ask in <code>#alpine-devel</code>
on IRC.</p>

<ul>
{% for branch, _ in config['SECFIXES_REPOSITORIES'].items() %}
<li><a href="{{ url_for('show_branch', branch=branch) }}">Vulnerable packages in {{ branch }}</a></li>
{% endfor %}
